<div><href scr='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5EaBzgCqUoDwCfQvfiCeSnAxKC7P_L-C9-8bRpkWUw/edit?tab=t.0'>This</href> report details the implementation of a high-performance deep learning framework designed to address real-world label noise in the CIFAR-100-N dataset. By integrating EfficientNet "Noisy Student" architectures, a custom hybrid caching system, and batch-level augmentation (CutMix/MixUp), the system achieves high accuracy and stability despite human-annotated label errors.</div>
